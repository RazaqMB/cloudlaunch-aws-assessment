## Task 1: Static Website Hosting Using S3 + IAM
- Created 3 S3 buckets:
  - **cloudlaunch-site-bucket17** â†’ hosts the static website (index.html, styles.css, etc.).
  - **cloudlaunch-private-bucket17** â†’ private bucket, only accessible via IAM user with GetObject/PutObject permissions.
  - **cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket17** â†’ bucket that can be listed but objects are not accessible.
- Enabled **static website hosting** on `cloudlaunch-site-bucket17`.
- Attached a **bucket policy** to allow public `GetObject` access.
- Created IAM user `cloudlaunch-user` with custom JSON policy.
- Restricted permissions:
  - Can only list all three buckets.
  - Can GetObject/PutObject in `cloudlaunch-private-bucket17`.
  - Can GetObject in `cloudlaunch-site-bucket17`.
  - Cannot delete objects.
  - Cannot read `cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket17` contents.

### Static Website Link
ðŸ‘‰ http://cloudlaunch-site-bucket17.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

## Task 2: VPC Design
- Created VPC `cloudlaunch17-vpc` with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`.
- Subnets:
  - **10.0.1.0/24** â†’ Public subnet17 (for future load balancer).
  - **10.0.2.0/24** â†’ Application subnet17 (private).
  - **10.0.3.0/28** â†’ Database subnet17 (private).
- Internet Gateway: `cloudlaunch17-igw` attached to the VPC.
- Route Tables:
  - `cloudlaunch-public-rt17` â†’ routes `0.0.0.0/0` to IGW, associated with public subnet.
  - `cloudlaunch-app-rt17` â†’ private, no internet route.
  - `cloudlaunch-db-rt17` â†’ private, no internet route.
- Security Groups:
  - `cloudlaunch-app-sg17`: allows HTTP (80) only within VPC.
  - `cloudlaunch-db-sg17`: allows MySQL (3306) only from app subnet.
